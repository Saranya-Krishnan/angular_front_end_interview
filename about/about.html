<p>This application creates random tests for Front End Web Technical Interviews.</p>

<p>The original source for the questions is <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">from the h5bp Front End Developer Interview Questions project.</a></p>

<p>I'm currently doing a manual grab of the source README.mdn, running it through a Markdown Processor (http://dillinger.io/), and then parsing the results into a list of JS objects. It is not ideal but the best short-term solution I could come up with. If you have any comments, <a href="https://github.com/cch5ng/angular_front_end_interview/issues" target="_blank">please open an issue.</a> Thanks!</p>
