# Application for Front End Interview Questions

* As an entry level Front End Web Developer, I got interested in creating an application that would give random interview questions for testing myself
* [The source of these questions is from another github repo](http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/)
* My initial idea is to create a basic application (form and output) for people who would take technical interview tests
* A second idea would be to create another application to people who would give technical interview tests (hiring managers, lead programmers).
  * Initial feature ideas include the ability to save favorite questions (boiler plate interview questions)
  * A print stylesheet for only the interview questions
  * Ability to prioritize favorite questions (like from easiest to hardest, or other)
  * If you have additional suggestions, please open an issue/feature request

## Caveats

* In the current form, as a web scraper, this source code is extremely brittle and if the original questions source contributors decide to change the format of their source html page, this application may break
* It would be better to parse the text from the main source README.mdn file but this is currently a little outside of my abilities
